### Master Task List Structure
The `.kiro/specs/momentum-net-worth-tracker/tasks.md` file serves as the single source of truth for all project tasks and should be structured as follows:

```markdown
# Momentum Development Tasks

## Current Sprint (Dates)
### In Progress
- [ ] Task 1 (Assigned to: Name, Size: M)
- [ ] Task 2 (Assigned to: Name, Size: S)

### Ready for Development
- [ ] Task 3 (Size: L, Dependencies: Task 1)
- [ ] Task 4 (Size: M, No dependencies)

### Blocked
- [ ] Task 5 (Blocked by: External dependency)

## Backlog
### High Priority
- [ ] Feature A implementation
- [ ] Critical bug fixes

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Enhancement B
- [ ] Technical debt items

### Low Priority
- [ ] Nice-to-have features
- [ ] Future considerations
```

### Task Reference Patterns
When referencing tasks in code, commits, or documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Implements net worth calculation feature
 * 
 * Task Reference: .kiro/specs/momentum-net-worth-tracker/tasks.md - "Dashboard Net Worth Display" (Task #12)
 * Requirements: .kiro/specs/momentum-net-worth-tracker/requirements.md - "Financial Calculations"
 * Design: .kiro/specs/momentum-net-worth-tracker/design.md - "Dashboard Layout"
 */
export const calculateNetWorth = (assets: Asset[], liabilities: Liability[]): number => {
  // Implementation
};
```

```bash
# Commit message referencing tasks
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): implement net worth display

Completes Task #12 from .kiro/specs/momentum-net-worth-tracker/tasks.md
- Add net worth calculation function
- Create dashboard display component  
- Include month-over-month change indicator
