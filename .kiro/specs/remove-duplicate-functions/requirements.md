# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing duplicate `isValidISODateTime` functions across multiple TypeScript files and consolidating them to use the existing centralized implementation in the shared utilities. This will improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and ensure consistent validation behavior across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate duplicate `isValidISODateTime` functions, so that the codebase is more maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be only one implementation of `isValidISODateTime` function
2. WHEN the function is needed THEN it SHALL be imported from the shared utilities module
3. WHEN validation occurs THEN all files SHALL use the same validation logic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all type files to import the validation function from utilities, so that changes to validation logic only need to be made in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a type file needs ISO datetime validation THEN it SHALL import `isValidISODateTime` from `src/shared/utils`
2. WHEN the import is added THEN the local duplicate function SHALL be removed
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing tests to continue passing, so that the refactoring doesn't break any functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
2. WHEN validation is performed THEN the behavior SHALL be identical to before the refactoring
3. WHEN the code is executed THEN there SHALL be no runtime errors due to missing imports
